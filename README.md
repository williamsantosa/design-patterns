# Design Patterns

Practicing common design patterns

- [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

## What is a Design Pattern?

- Typical solutions to recurring problems in software design
  - Customizable pre-made blueprints
- Consisted of:
  - Intent of the pattern (problem & solution)
  - Motivation explains why it works
  - Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and their relations
  - Code examples to make it easier to understand

## Why learn patterns?

- Toolkit of tried and tested solutions
- Define a common language that can be communicated between people
  - "Oh, just use a singleton"

## Criticism

- Weak programming languages lacking abstraction
- Inefficient solutions if implemented without fitting to the project context
- Unjustified use if something simple uses a complex design, maybe doesn't evne need an abstraction

## Classifications

- Basic and low-level patterns are called *idioms*, applied to only a single programming language (usually)
- Universal and high-level patterns are called *architectural patterns*, applied to (most) languages
- Intent:
  - Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms increasing flexibility and reuse
  - Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures
  - Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and assignment of repsonsibilities between objects
